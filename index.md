## Nanooptics and Raman sensing lab (LIN LAB AT SJTU)

The interface between light and materials creates unique optical properties at the nanoscale, enabling the manipulation and transport of light in a controlled manner. With the use of nanomaterial tools, we can study the interaction of biological molecules, cells, or tissues with optical nanostructures. <br> 
We are a multidisciplinary nanooptics laboratory at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Our group members are from various backgrounds in materials science, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, biology, physics, medicine, and other disciplines. We are a tiny and compact group working with Dr. Li LIN at SJTU.

We use state-of-the-art nanofabrication and simulation technologies to design and fabricate plasmonic nanostructures as ultrasensitive nanosensors for trace detection. In particular, we have focused on surface-enhanced Raman scattering as a bioimaging modality for in vivo surgical navigation or as an optical platform to study bio-material interfaces. We collaborate closely with other groups to address fundamental questions in biological metabolism and tumor phenotype development using advanced optical techniques.
