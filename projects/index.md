Non-invasive localization of human lesions remains a long-standing pursuit for clinical applications. Optical modalities are widely used for biomedical imaging and diagnosing. But due to the strong photon absorption and scattering of biological tissues, it is challenging to realize in vivo non-invasive detection via optical modalities.<br>
We address this issue with the use of in vivo surface-enhanced deep Raman spectroscopy (SEDRS) with a series of advancements toward non-invasive localization of deep lesions hidden in living animals. We made the first quantitative assessments of Raman spectroscopic detection depth into the biological tissues. We have developed high-brightness SERS nanotags and a home-built transmission Raman system, enabling detection through >10 cm of biological tissue under safe laser exposure (Small Methods, 2022). We put forward a depth-prediction method based on Raman spectral peak ratios, leveraging tissue optical properties to accurately determine the depth of lesion phantoms, achieving the mean error of <11.8% (View, 2023, 20230022). Based on this, the non-invasive localization of lesion phantom using multi-peak information of Raman spectra in ex vivo tissues (ACS AMI, 2023) or in live animals was achieved (Advanced Science, 2023). We completed the first SEDRS-guided peri-operative lymph node biopsy on a live rat, demonstrating centimeter-level detection depth and millimeter-level localization precision. <br>

Modern cancer diagnosis requires histological, molecular and genomic tumor analysis. These approaches are usually resource-intensive and time-consuming. We use highly specific Raman spectroscopy to differentiate the diseased part by the contribution of Raman-active molecules in different tissues. The detected signal provides molecular information that enables accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Our label-free detection research often push the limits of existing technologies. We thus use the computational power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve our understanding of the spectral properties of biomolecules.

Plasmonic nanostructures exhibit a unique combination of physical, chemical, and biological properties, such as large absorption and scattering cross-sections, high sensitivity to the local dielectric environment, and an enhanced electric field at the surface. We use surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a bioimaging modality for spectral-guided surgery. We fabricate plasmonic nanomaterials with tunable optical properties by adjusting the surface chemistry and texture of designer materials. The integration of metal structures and organic materials form a powerful platform for a wide variety of applications including plasmonic photovoltaics, chemical and biological sensors, bioimaging, and therapeutics.
