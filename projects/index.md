Plasmonic nanostructures exhibit a unique combination of physical, chemical, and biological properties, such as large absorption and scattering cross sections, high sensitivity to the local dielectric environment, and an enhanced electric field at the surface. We have focused on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a bioimaging modality for spectral-guided surgical navigation. We fabricate plasmonic nanomaterials with tunable optical properties by adjusting the surface chemistry and texture of designer materials. The integration of metal structures and organic materials form a powerful platform for a wide variety of applications including plasmonic photovoltaics, chemical and biological sensors, bioimaging, and therapeutics.

Non-invasive localization of human lesions remains a long-standing pursuit for clinical applications. Optical modalities are widely used for biomedical imaging and diagnosing. But due to the strong photon absorption and scattering of biological tissues, it is challenging to realize in vivo non-invasive detection via optical modalities. We address this tissue with the use of in vivo surface-enhanced transmission Raman spectroscopy (TRS). We achieve non-invasive localization of deep lesions hidden in living animals and precisely predicted the depth of deep-seated lesions in heterogeneous in vivo environments.

Modern cancer diagnosis requires histological, molecular and genomic tumor analysis. These approaches are usually resource-intensive and time-consuming. We use highly specific Raman spectroscopy to differentiate the diseased part by the contribution of Raman-active molecules in different tissues.

Nanomaterials have emerging applications in medical implants, cell delivery, and in vivo neuromodulation. The interaction of biomolecules with metal nanostructures can be studied by investigating the near-field plasmon effects.
