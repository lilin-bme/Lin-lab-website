### BIOGRAPHY 
Dr. Linley Li Lin is currently an Assistant Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). She received her B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from SJTU and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and SJTU. During her Ph.D. and postdoctoral work, she was one of the early researchers on gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs), a novel optical Raman label with ultra-high sensitivity, uniformity, and photostability. Her current research interests include deep Raman techniques, surface-enhanced Raman scattering bioimaging in the second NIR window, and an in vitro Raman platform to study biomaterial interfaces. She has developed in vivo transmission Raman spectroscopy techniques for deep Raman imaging and three-dimensional tomography. Dr. Lin has received a number of awards, including the Shanghai Chenguang Young Scholar Program (2021) and the Best Paper Award at the IMCO International Conference (2019).
